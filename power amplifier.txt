                                                     Poower amplifiers


power amplifiers are used to boost the power level of signals.they are mainly used in audio communication systems.
it converts the dc input poer poer into usefull ac output power and controlls it using the input voltage.the 
efficiency of a power amplifier lies in its ability to perform this conversion.its used at the last stage of 
amplification where its connected with the loudspeaker.it preffers power saving rather than providing leniarity.
