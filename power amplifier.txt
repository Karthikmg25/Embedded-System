                                                     Poower amplifiers



power amplifiers are used to boost the power level of signals.they are mostly used in audio communication systems.
it converts the dc input power into usefull ac output power and provides a high power output signal.the 
efficiency of a power amplifier lies in its ability to perform this conversion.its used at the last stage of 
amplification where its connected with the loudspeaker.it preffers power saving rather than providing leniarity.
Single ended power amplifiers are ineffient in terms of saving power,so most power amplifiers are double ended ,means
they use two transistors.power amplifiers can be classified on the basis of region at which the transistor operates.
it comes under class A if operating at active region,
class B if operates at the cut off,
class AB if operates just above the cut off and class C if operates below the cut off.
